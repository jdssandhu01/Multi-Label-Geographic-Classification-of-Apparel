# Multi-Label-Geographic-Classification-of-Apparel
This project is based on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning to classify apparel based on different labels such as geographic region, color, pattern, and gender. This project is divided into three subcategories - classification based on geographic region, classification of Western apparel, and classification of Indian apparel. All of these subtypes are based on labels - color, pattern, and gender.
